# Research Internship at Aero2Astro
### Mentor: Mr. Ted Solomon and Mr. Hemanth Balaji Dandi

### During this internship, I worked on various object detection models. I worked on COCO dataset, from which I took specific classes and trained following models on that dataset

### <li> YOLO v4 </li>
### <li> Paddle Paddle YOLO v1</li>
### <li> Paddle Paddle YOLO v2</li>

### After that, I collected the TTPLA dataset for aerial inspection, and trained following models on the transmission tower subset
### <li> Paddle Paddle YOLO v2</li>
### <li> Scaled YOLO v4</li>

### After that, during the final phase of this internship, I worked on Chinese Insulator dataset. For this, I trained the YOLO v4 model on this dataset.
